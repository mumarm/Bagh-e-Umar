# Bagh-e-Umar
This is Umar's digital garden.
I am using this to share what I learn, publish notes on my interests & have a way to quickly provide resume and portfolio items at one place.

Thanks to Peter's Obsidian-Zola for quick & easy setup.
Thanks to Obsidian for markdown, Gitub for hosting my repository & Netlify for free deployment.
