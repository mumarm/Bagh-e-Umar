***Speaking at panel discussion on behalf of T4L***

I was honoured to speak at a panel discussion at a conference hosted by doctHERs (T4L's client) on Women Empowerment & Role of Digital Health. I shared about the importance of women empowerment along with examples of participants from our on-going projects in war-torn Afghanistan. I also shared our findings from research study & on-field project reports on the role of mHealth (Mobile Health) in getting timely and appropriate treatment for mental health patients. I learned a lot from the input of other participants and stakeholders in the then infant digital health ecosystem of Pakistan.

Panelists included doctors, healthcare practitioners & reputable professionals from Unilever, GSK & NayaJeevan etc.
