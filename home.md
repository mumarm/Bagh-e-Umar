## Introduction

Hello & As'salamu Alaekum (Peace be on you)! Thank you for walking into my digital garden. I hope you like it here.

My name is Muhammad Umar Muzaffar and I am from Pakistan. I made this digital garden to share credentials, document learning journey and share it with the world.

I am a student of Social Sciences; studied #Marketing & #Economics in particular & Business Administration in general. I help businesses with developing marketing strategies, writing marketing copy & enhancing customer experience.

I enjoy reading about History, Science, Human Behaviour & Productivity. I watch documentaries & play video games in my spare time. I'm a cat person & love petting strays.

Feel free to explore my digital garden & you are welcome to suggest improvements.
