## Introduction

Hello & As'salamu Alaekum (Peace be on you)! Thank you for walking into my digital garden. I really hope you like it here.

My name is Muhammad Umar Muzaffar and I am from Pakistan. This digital garden is a way to document my learning journey and share it with the world.

I am a student of Social Sciences; studied #Marketing & #Economics in particular & Business Administration in general. I help businesses with developing solid marketing strategies, writing good marketing copy & working on customer experience.

I enjoy reading non-fiction, watch documentaries & play video games in my spare time. I'm a cat person & love petting strays.

Feel free to explore my digital garden or suggest improvements.
